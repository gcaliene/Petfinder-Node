#This app is to provide pet owners, dog walkers, or those who spend alot of time outside an option to report and find lost animals. For future updates, I will insert a google map api where it can receive the lat and long of users and place it on a map.

#Users will also be able to upload their pictures of the lost animals sighted.

#Right now all users have access to each others post and can delete and edit at will. I'm going to make sure that users can edit and delete their own posts in a future update. 

#I'm currently looking at possible layouts for the "dashboard page" that users will see when first logging on. I might use flexbox rather than the generic 12 col method.
